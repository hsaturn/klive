Attempt to create a modern a powerful ZX Spectrum IDE

![Alt text](doc/ide-state.png?raw=true "Ide Status")

The goal is to have ( - planned, * in progress, > done)

Still no prompt yet. Z80 not finished.
But the spectrum is booting.

![Alt text](doc/screen.png?raw=true "Screen")

* Modern all in one IDE
- All in one tool (except the C compiler)
- Z80 Asm included with syntax colored editor
- C compiler (external)
- Resource editor (Sprites)
- Real time compilation / execution of project
- Debugger
- ROM RAM viewer
- ROM/RAM Disassembler Routines labels (custom)
* ZX 48 Emulator (mine, so it won't be so accurate but should play games)
  -> I hope with enhanced tools like stack overflow detection etc...
> Zx Screen emulation
* Some useless so essential gadgets (clock, lines -> for UI Architecture tests)

And if all is working as expected, I'll enhance the project
with common features
- Plugins
- Tap / Tzx loader
- 128K
- Printer emulation
- ZX Interface 1 emulation
- Internet direct games downloads with search tool
