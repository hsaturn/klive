Spectrum emulator/IDO, Work in progress (10/2020)

The emulator boot until the prompt is displayed
(c) 1982 Sinclair Reseach Ltd

Now I new to emulate the keyboard.
------

Attempt to create a modern and powerful for
the old and excellent ZX Spectrum IDE
But the spectrum is booting.

![Alt text](doc/ide-state.png?raw=true "Ide Status")

Planned features : planned, * in progress, > done)

* Modern all in one IDE
- All in one tool (except the C compiler)
- Z80 Asm included with syntax colored editor
- C compiler (external)
- Resource editor (Sprites)
- Real time compilation / execution of project
> Debugger
> ROM RAM viewer
> ROM/RAM Disassembler Routines labels (custom)
* ZX 48 Emulator (mine, so it won't be so accurate but should play games)
  -> I hope with enhanced tools like stack overflow detection etc...
* Zx Screen emulation (missing borders)
* Some useless so essential gadgets (clock, lines -> for UI Architecture tests)

And if all is working as expected, I'll enhance the project
with common features
- Plugins
- Tap / Tzx loader
- 128K
- Printer emulation
- ZX Interface 1 emulation
- Internet direct games downloads with search tool
